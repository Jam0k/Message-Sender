# Message-Sender

This code is a Python program that creates a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application for sending messages to a range of IP addresses within a specified subnet, using either UDP or TCP protocol.

To use this application, you simply input the desired subnet, start and end IP addresses, port, timeout (for TCP), message, and choose the protocol (UDP or TCP) from the drop-down. Once you've provided the necessary information, click the Send button to start the process. You can also stop the process using the Stop button, load/save configurations, and monitor the progress in the progress bar and log view.

Configuration file is JSON format.

To run this application, simply execute the following command. python .\Message_Sender_for_IP_Address_Ranges.py
